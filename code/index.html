            <B>What is DBMS ?</B><BR>
            Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries
            on data. A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read,
            update, and delete data in the database.
            <br>
            DBMS provides an environment to store and retrieve the data in coinvent and efficient manner.<br>
            A database is a collection of interrelated data which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and
            deletion of data from the database and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports,
            etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Structured query language (SQL)</b> is a programming language for storing and processing information in a
            relational database. A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns
            representing different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values.<br><br>
            PL/SQL stands for <b>“Procedural Language extensions to SQL.”</b> PL/SQL is a database-oriented programming
            language that extends SQL with procedural capabilities.The PL/SQL is known for its combination of data
            manipulating power of SQL with data processing power of
            procedural languages. It inherits the robustness, security, and portability of the Oracle Database.<br><br>
