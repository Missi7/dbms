    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>What is SQL ?</b></h3>

    SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a powerful programming language designed for managing and manipulating
    relational databases. Developed in the 1970s, SQL has become the standard language for interacting with
    databases, providing a standardized way to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, and defining
    database structures.

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"> <b>Key Concepts</b></h3>
    <b>Data Definition Language (DDL):</b> DDL commands enable users to define and manage the structure of a database.
    This
    includes creating and altering database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints.
    <br><br>
    <b>Data Manipulation Language (DML):</b> SQL includes commands for querying and modifying data within a database.
    Common
    DML commands include SELECT (retrieve data), INSERT (add new records), UPDATE (modify existing records), and DELETE
    (remove records).
    <br><br>
    <b>Control Language (DCL):</b> DCL commands govern access to the database. They include commands such as GRANT
    (assign
    privileges) and REVOKE (remove privileges), which control who can access and manipulate data within the database.
