    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>What is Views?</b></h3>
    In databases, a view is a virtual table that is based on the result set of a SELECT query. Unlike physical tables,
    views do not store data themselves; they are essentially saved queries that dynamically generate the result set when
    queried. Views can simplify complex queries, abstract the underlying data model, and provide a security mechanism by
    restricting access to certain columns or rows of a table.
    <br><br>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Key Points of Views:</b></h3>
    <b><u>Structure:</u></b> Views have a structure similar to tables, with columns and rows, but they do not store any
    data directly.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Virtual:</u></b> Views are virtual tables, meaning they are not physical entities and do not occupy storage
    space.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Schema Binding:</u></b> Views can be schema-bound, meaning they are bound to the schema of the underlying
    tables. This
    ensures that the underlying schema cannot be modified in a way that would break the view.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Security:</u></b> Views can be used to control access to data by providing a restricted view of the underlying
    tables. Users
    can be granted access to views without granting direct access to the underlying tables.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Complex Queries:</u></b> Views can simplify complex queries by encapsulating logic and calculations into a
    single object
    that can be queried like a table.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Performance:</u></b> Views can improve query performance by pre-computing and caching results, especially for
    frequently
    used or complex queries.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Modifiability:</u></b> Some views are updatable, meaning they can be used to insert, update, or delete rows
    from the
    underlying tables, provided certain conditions are met.
