    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Cursors in PL/SQL</b></h3>
    In the context of databases and SQL, a cursor is a database object used to retrieve and manipulate data from a
    result set returned by a SQL query. Cursors provide a way to iterate over the rows of a result set one at a time,
    enabling programmatic control over data retrieval and manipulation. Here's an explanation of cursors:

    There are two types of Cursors:
    1) Implicit Cursors 2) Explicit Cursors

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Attributes of cursors</b></h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <b>
                <th>Attributes</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </b>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>%FOUND </td>
            <td>Returns TRUE if a fetch operation successfully retrieves a row.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>%NOTFOUND </td>
            <td>Returns TRUE if a fetch operation fails to retrieve a row</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>%ROWCOUNT </td>
            <td>Returns the number of rows fetched so far.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>%ISOPEN </td>
            <td>Returns TRUE if the cursor is open, FALSE if closed.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Basic Functionality :</b></h3>
    <b><u>Initialization :</u></b> Cursors are initialized with a SQL query that defines the result set to be processed.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Execution :</u></b> After initialization, the cursor is executed, and the query is executed against the
    database to fetch
    the result set.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Iteration :</u></b> Cursors allow the program to fetch rows from the result set one at a time. The cursor
    keeps track of the
    current position within the result set.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Processing :</u></b> Each fetched row can be processed individually within the program. This includes reading
    the values of
    columns, performing calculations, and executing further logic based on the row's data.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Termination :</u></b> Cursors are typically closed once all rows in the result set have been processed.
    Closing the cursor
    releases associated resources and frees up database server memory.
    <br><br>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Cursor Operations :</b></h3>
    <b><u>Opening :</u></b> The cursor is opened to execute the associated SQL query and fetch the result set.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Fetching :</u></b> Rows from the result set are retrieved one by one using the FETCH statement. Each fetch
    operation
    advances the cursor to the next row.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Closing :</u></b> Once all rows have been processed, or when no longer needed, the cursor is closed using the
    CLOSE
    statement. This releases database resources associated with the cursor.<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b></b></h3>
